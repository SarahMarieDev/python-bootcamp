# Pomodoro Timer

## Introduction
This project implements a simple Pomodoro Timer using Python's `tkinter` library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features
- **Customizable Time Intervals**: Set times for work periods, short breaks, and long breaks.
- **Color-Coded Labels**: Visual feedback with color changes indicating different periods (Work, Short Break, Long Break).
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicator of completed work sessions with checkmarks.
- **Interactive UI**: Start and reset the timer through buttons in a user-friendly interface.

## Dependencies
This application is built with Python and requires:
- Python 3.9.16
- tkinter library
- `math` library for basic calculations

Ensure you have Python and tkinter installed on your machine. Tkinter is included with Python in standard installations.

## Setup
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

## Usage
From the pomodoro-timer directory, run the script using Python3:
```bash
python3 main.py
